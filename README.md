Design tenets:
- Make code easier to understand and maintain by:
  - Thoroughly documenting functionality
  - Organizing code in a modular fashion
  - Use TypeScript (at least in backend) for strong type-checking
- Otherwise keep infrastructure as simple as reasonably possible
  - yarn for monorepo/workspace/package management
